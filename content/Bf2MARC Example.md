**Example of a Bf2MARC Bibliographic Record**

MARC bibliographic records transformed from BIBFRAME descriptions will contain all the data that is in a "traditional" MARC record, but the data may appear in different parts of the MARC record. A transformed MARC bibliographic record will also contain URIs for much of the data. 

MARC bibliographic records transformed from BIBFRAME descriptions are called "Modern MARC" records since they use many of the recently approved MARC fields and subfields. 

Here is an example of a Modern MARC bibliographic record.
